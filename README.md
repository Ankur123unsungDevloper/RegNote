# RegNote

## 📘 Project Overview

RegNote is a web application designed to digitize and organize school or college class notes, addressing the challenges students and teachers face in creating and maintaining handwritten notes. Originally conceptualized during my BCA final year as a group project with five classmates, the project was partially developed and demonstrated at that time. Now, as part of my MCA capstone project, I am advancing RegNote to include additional features and improve its functionality.

RegNote is a modern web application that digitizes and organizes class notes for students and teachers. It addresses the inefficiencies of handwritten note-taking by providing an intuitive digital platform where users can create, organize, and collaborate on academic notes.

Initially conceptualized to solve real classroom problems, RegNote has evolved into a user-centric note management solution inspired by platforms like **Notion** and **Trello**.
